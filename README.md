# Processing Rosetta Code Examples
Example set for [Processing](http://processing.org)
from [Rosetta Code](http://rosettacode.org/).

This set of example Processing sketches compiles the available Processing
versions of tasks on Rosetta Code. The examples are directly downloadable from
the repository. They may also be loaded directly into the Processing PDE
desktop environment through Contributions Manager under the Examples tab.

> Rosetta Code is a programming chrestomathy site. The idea is to present
> solutions to the same task in as many different languages as possible, to
> demonstrate how languages are similar and different, and to aid a person
> with a grounding in one approach to a problem in learning another.

Rosetta Code has ~1000 tasks including file and sysem access, string manipulation, math problems, graphics output and more -- with some of these tasks implemented in dozens or even hundreds of programming languages. A few examples include:

-  Archimedean spiral
-  Draw a sphere
-  Fibonacci sequence
-  FizzBuzz
-  Hello world/Text
-  Image noise
-  Levenshtein distance
-  Mandelbrot set
-  Palindrome detection
-  Rename a file

Simply put, this project both solicits Processing contributions to Rosetta Code and curates the resulting examples as a set for Processing language learners.


## Getting the examples

Examples are available from the github project homepage:
https://github.com/jeremydouglass/processing_rosetta_examples

You may download the files as a zip or clone the repository using the
"Clone or Download" button.

Another option is to install all the examples through the desktop Processing
Development Environment (PDE). From the menu, File > Examples > Add Examples
will open the Contributions Manager to the Examples tab. Download the example
set. All sketches will be installed in the Examples subfolder of your
Processing data folder, and available through the Examples pop-up menu.


##  License and Contributions

This example set uses the same open documentation license as the Rosetta Code Project, and contributes and redistributes Processing Examples under those same terms.
